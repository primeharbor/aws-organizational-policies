# Curated list of Security Invariants to enforce with Organizational Policies

AWS defines a security invariant as:
> a system property that relates to the systemâ€™s ability to prevent security issues from happening. Security invariants are statements that **will always hold true** for your business and applications.

A key clause here is that the invariant is always true, which means the exceptions to the invariant must be implemented as part of the invariant.

What follows is a collection of Security and Governance Invariants I like to enforce in my organizations:

# Governance Invariants

## Only the Network Engineering team may create a VPC, alter route tables, or attach an IGW.
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Gov-ControlVPCManagement](Policies/Gov-ControlVPCManagement.md)\
Exception: Deny unless action made by the Cloud Networking Role

## Only Procurement may subscribe to or accept an offer in AWS Marketplace.
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Gov-DenyMarketplace](Policies/Gov-DenyMarketplace.md)\
Exception: Deny unless action made by the Procurement Identity Center Role

## Only Cloud Engineering can enable new opt-in regions
... after ensuring GRC sign-off and the implementation of appropriate security telemetry and governance controls.

Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Gov-DenyEnableNewRegions](Policies/Gov-DenyEnableNewRegions.md)\
Exception: Deny unless action made by the Cloud Engineering Role

## Resources may only be deployed into the US or Europe Regions
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Gov-DisableRegionsPolicy](Policies/Gov-DisableRegionsPolicy.md)\
Exception: Deny unless the target region is in a list of approved regions.

Different regional lists can be applied to different OUs depending on business need. This policy excludes a number of auditing roles necessary to ensure nothing exists in the un-approved regions.

# General Security Invariants

## All new S3 Buckets must be created with ACLs disabled.
Type: Resource Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-EnforceS3ACLDisabled](ResourceControlPolicies/Sec-EnforceS3ACLDisabled.md)\
Exception: This RCP only applies to bucket creation. A user could enable ACLs post creation.

## Only approved External AWS Accounts may assume into our organization
Type: Resource Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-AssumeRoleApproval](ResourceControlPolicies/Sec-AssumeRoleApproval.md)

The list of external accounts is the exception to the invariant. This list would (theoretically) require the cloud engineering team to approve and apply a PR to the IaC repo that manages these policies.

## Only Cloud Engineering, coming from the Atlanta office or VPN, may log in as root
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-RootUsage](Policies/Sec-RootUsage.md)

This SCP applies to the usage of `sts:AssumeRoot` that is part of [Centralized Root Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-enable-root-access.html).

## Only the Cloud Engineering Team may Delete a custom key store or imported key material, and the deletion must be done from the office
Type: Resource Control Policy or Service Control Policy\
Resource Control Policy: [KMS-KeyProtectionRCP](ResourceControlPolicies/KMS-KeyProtectionRCP.md)\
Service Control Policy: [KMS-KeyProtection](Policies/KMS-KeyProtection.md)

## No one may alter the core security & governance IAM Roles
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Gov-PreventCriticalRoleModification](Policies/Gov-PreventCriticalRoleModification.md)

## All EC2 Instances must launch with IMDSv2
Type: Declarative Policy\
Policy: [Sec-EnforceIMDSv2](DeclarativePolicies/Sec-EnforceIMDSv2.md)

This Declarative Policy has no exceptions, so be careful with its application. If you must allow IMDSv1 on a specific account, there is an overriding Declarative Policy that can be applied on a per-account basis.

# Public Resource Protection

## Only the Security and Privacy team may make an S3 Bucket Public
Type: Resource Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-S3BlockExternalAccess](DeclarativePolicies/Sec-S3BlockExternalAccess.md)\
Exceptions: The list of approved public buckets is managed in the policy. This would (theoretically) require the cloud engineering team to approve and apply a PR to the IaC repo that manages these policies.

**Warning**: RCPs have a limit of 5120 characters (including whitespace). At a large organization with a large number of public buckets you may exceed the size limits.

## AMIs and SnapShots may never be shared with all AWS accounts
Type: Declarative Policy\
Policy: [Sec-PreventPublicImageSnapshot](DeclarativePolicies/Sec-PreventPublicImageSnapshot.md)\
Optional Clause: "unless shared from the product publishing AWS account" - then you would only want to apply a different Declarative Policy to override.

## KMS Keys and Secrets Manager Secrets must not be shared outside of our organization
Type: Resource Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-ProtectKMSandSecrets](ResourceControlPolicies/Sec-ProtectKMSandSecrets.md)

## Lambda functions may not be publicly invocable or leverage unauthenticated Function URLs.
Type: Service Control Policy\
Policy: [Sec-PreventPubliclyInvocableLambda](Policies/Sec-PreventPubliclyInvocableLambda.md)
